                     <p align="justify">We will collect and use personal information about you to respond to your request for products and services offered through the Site. Specifically, we collect information provided by you in connection with obtaining quotes for insurance products and services. For example, you will be asked to provide your full name, address, telephone number, email, and other information in order to be matched to carriers and agents who may provide you a quote for their services. We also collect demographic information. Demographic information is all other information such as gender, zip code, or any information that is not tied to your personal information.

                        <br>Quote Requests. If you submit a request on the Site for quotes for products or services, we will share the personal information contained in your request form (such as your full name, address, telephone number, email, information about your cars, etc.) with third parties, which include agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other service providers (Service Providers) in our network to process and fulfill your request for quotes. In some circumstances, we may obtain additional information about you and/or share that information with Service Providers in our network. For example, we may now or in the future use your Social Security Number, your Year of Birth, or your personal information to obtain your credit report and credit score to help us better match you with Service Providers. All Service Providers in our network have entered into agreements with us, and are required to comply with federal and state privacy regulations. By submitting your request to us, you understand that Service Providers may contact you by telephone (on a recorded line), automated calling, email, SMS/text messaging or regular mail based on the information you provided to us in order to process and fulfill your request, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call List, or the Do Not Call List of an internal company. If one of the Service Providers contacts you and you wish not to be contacted again by that Service Provider with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that Service Provider not to contact you again. Please note that the Service Providers may maintain the information you provided whether you elect to use their services.
                        <br>Aggregate, Non-Personal, or De-identified Information. We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal, de-identified, or anonymous information we collect with third parties, including affiliates to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Site and on the websites of third parties.
                        <br>As Required by Law. We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances.
